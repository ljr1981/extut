# Extut - Elixir Tutorial

This projects code is contained in a single defmodule of M.ex (see libs folder).

It is my typed code based on following the YouTube tutorial at:

The code is not just a "tag-along" follow of the presenter (Derek Banas). I do take some liberties with the code (and will do a review over time and learning as I gain more knowledge).

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `extut` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:extut, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/extut](https://hexdocs.pm/extut).
